# Using Spotify API to explore Mac Miller's Discography

### Description

An introductory exploration of utilizing Spotify's API to access song and streaming data.

### Purpose

This serves as an introduction to working with APIs for data sourcing, working with a version control software (git), and maintaining a properly documented project from start to finish.

The project will focus on Mac Miller's [discography](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4LLpKhyESsyAXpc4laK94U), and take a look at how his music style changed as he matured and began working with more experimental sounds and genres. 

### Research Questions

These are the questions I hope to answer throughout this project.

- In what way can music be measured quantitatively? How can these values be found, assigned, and used?
- How did Mac's music change over time? What periods represented the largest changes?
- What sub-genres emerge from analysis of his discography? Can songs be assigned accurately using a clustering algorithm?
- How do the lyrics and the tonality of the songs fit together?

### Goal Model

Using the data aforementioned, my goal for this model is to predict which album, or timeframe, a particular song belongs to. I think this will be a little challenging, as music is often one of those things that is typically measured qualitatively, and might be hard to assign values to.
